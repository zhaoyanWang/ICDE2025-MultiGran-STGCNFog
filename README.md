MultiGran-STGCNFog-ICDE2025 

This is an anonymous repository for paper manuscript "MultiGran-STGCNFog: Towards Fast and Accurate Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting" submitted to ICDE2025 RESEARCH PAPER SECOND SUBMISSION CYCLE Track, due to ICDE2025's call for availability: 
papers to make their code, data, scripts, and notebooks available if this is possible.
Hence, we provide patial and key segments of Data, Scripts, Model Structures, trained model and prediction outputs for review process if needed. Tentative to be fully open-sourced after Acceptance, as appropriate. 

Contents available: 

Raw data CSV, npz 
Data processing, multi-granularity generation scripts processed data, train&test&val datasets npz 
Scripts for MultiGran-STGCN and distributed parallel inference scheduling, model structures of MultiGran-STGCN, ablation variants and all baselines, profiling script and profiled data on devices in clusters etc. 
Model training & Evaluation results including best weight, evaluation logs, and npz prediction details.
